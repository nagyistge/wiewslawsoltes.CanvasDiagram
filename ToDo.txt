TODO:
- merge pins using Bounds not points
- merge standalone pins to element pins (when mowing over element show element pins and enable merging)
- merge pins to lines if not merging to line start or end (nearest point)
- diconnect wire from element pin (create temp standalone pin) use start/end pin bounds and move detection
- when moving disconnected wire (start or end pin not connected) reconnected to elements or wires when bounds intersect
- add automatic line and element orto option to align all elements in grid and have all lines straight (as old sketchpad)
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad
- filter touch event stream (when moving) to optimize redrawing
- use element pool for Parses when creating new elements (also other cases of element creation)
- wires should be drawn in lower Z order then other elements (below elements)
- handle touch math in drawing thread (maybe by add some abstracted mode enums)
- add bigger bounding box for standalone pins
- add undo/redo widget to canvas (drawn on canvas using visible screen area - placed in top right corner)
- add insert widget to canvas (drawn on canvas using visible screen area - placed in top right corner)
- draw insert widget using dark transparent background draw over canvas elements
- add option to cancel drawing standalone pins
- add snap option
- add grid
- add zoom to fit option and enable it on create surface
- add solution and project strucure
- add export solution/project or diagram option (using android share functionality)
- add bounding box for elements (ie. for gate box should be width/height + pin radius)
- when finished editing check for changes (is diagram dirty flag), ask user to save/cancel/discard changes
